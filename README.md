# Horiseon Code Refactor

### This repository is a refactored code for a webpage.

> Much of the initial code had redundancies in CSS class styling, as well as little to no semantic HTML elements
>
> The purpose of this code refactor was to allow for better accessibility and to simplify the overall code.
